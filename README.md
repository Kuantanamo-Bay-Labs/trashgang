I programmed a minimalist tiny terminal chat you can run locally!

## ✿ Features (current & planned)

- [x] Local TUI client  (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧  
- [ ] Dedicated server (no ngrok) for public rooms and latency hugs  
- [ ] Pluggable mini-games (`/play`) for breaks between chats (o^▽^o)  
- [ ] Instead of using `|` to split, use a /ascii command!!
- [ ] Opt-in E2EE for private rooms (`/lock`)  
- [ ] My friend wants a way to add porn... We'll see.. Horny aah degenerate

## ✿ Why?

- Minimal, portable, and terminal-native. No heavy deps at all!!! (づ￣ ³￣)づ  
- For when you want privacy~
